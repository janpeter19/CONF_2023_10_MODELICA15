# CONF_2023_10_MODELICA15
Notebooks with examples presented in the paper "Design ideas behind Bioprocess Library for Modelica", by J. P. Axelsson,
presented at the 15th International Modelica Conference, Aachen, Germany, October 9-11, 2023, see 
the proceeding [here](https://ecp.ep.liu.se/index.php/modelica/issue/view/83) on page 453-462.

Click on Runtime/Run all - and then wait a couple of minutes for the packages to load, finally the script is run in seconds.
Feel free to continue to interact with the notebook. Note, you need to have a gmail-address to use Google Colab.

If you are interested in more complex models closer to the industrial reality, take a look at the repositories:

- BPL\_YEAST\_AIR\_Fedbatch - simulates yeast production and include by-product formation and dissolved oxygen control
- BPL\_CHO\_Fedbatch - mammalian cells CHO and include by-product formation and recombinant protein production
- BPL\_IEC_operation  - ion exhange chromatography used for separation of protein product from other proteins 

Note that:
* The script occassionaly get stuck during installation. Then just close the notebook and start from scratch.
* Remember, you need to have a google-account!

Just to be clear, no installation is done at your local computer.
